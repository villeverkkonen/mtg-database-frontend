## Drafting

You and 7 computer players each have 3 boosters, each containing 15 cards.
<br />
Everybody opens the first booster and picks one card (computers by random, no AI yet).
<br />
After picking a card, you pass your booster with 14 cards and get a 14 card booster from other player and so on...
<br />
When all 15 cards are picked, each player opens a new booster and repeat the previous process.
<br />
After drafting all 3 boosters you should have a 45 card deck.
<br />

The Drafted deck -button keeps count of your drafted cards.
